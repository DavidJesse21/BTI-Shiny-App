# BTI Shiny App

This has been my first attempt to build my own interactive app using R Shiny.

This app is about the [Bertelsmann Transformation Index](https://www.bti-project.org/de/home.html?&cb=00000), which is a project by the Bertelsmann Foundation aiming at measuring and evaluating the democratic and economic development of non-industrialized states.
The app contains a simple interactive data table, visualizations of the individual countries' indexes as well as a world map giving an overview of all countries and their democracy index.
